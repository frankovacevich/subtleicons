# Subtle Icons

Subtle Icons is a set of free icons for front-end development. The icons were designed
primarily for IoT applications, so most of them are related to that subject.

You can use the icons independently as SVGs or download the font version to include
them easily into CSS. The font was built using [icomoon.io](https://icomoon.io/)

The icons are licensed under the MIT License and are free to use in any project.
